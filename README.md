# Debug a Script Lab

## Objectives

1. Use Node built-in debugger by putting statements into a given script to find a problem by using debugger
1. Launch debugger
2. Fix the script

## Introduction

You've been hired by a major national bank to fix some of their account creation code. They had some bad developers in the past that left some bugs in the code. Your job is to fix all the issues and get the code functional again.

In this lab, you'll debug a Node script which has some issues. 

## Instructions

1. Open `account.js` then launch it from the command line with `node account`.
2. Find the issues
3. Put some `debugger` statements in `account.js`
4. Launch in debug mode with `node debug account`
5. Track the issues
6. Fix the file. (Hint: there are 3 issues to fix.)
7. Run test with `npm test`


The fixed script should output the following:

```
Account before opening:  { balance: 0, name: 'Azat Mardan', checking: '1' }
New balance after signup bonus is 250
Account after opening:  { balance: 1250,
  name: 'Azat Mardan',
  checking: '1',
  type: 'checking' }
```
